## Running legacy visual tests 

The **main** branch of the reposotory demonstrates the legacy visual tests for iOS application. 

### Clone repository
Clone the main branch of the repository with the following command:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:sbmallik/XCUITest-TAU.git
```
### Install Cocoapods

1. APPLITOOLS_API_KEY
1. APPLITOOLS_SERVER_URL
### Run the application
Click the Run button (right arrow) on the toolbar of Xcode to build and run the application.

### Run the visual test
